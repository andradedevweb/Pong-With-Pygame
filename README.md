## About the project
 This is my first game with a multiplatform game library called Pygame.

## How it works?

<ul>
 <li>To play, just install and run the game.py file</li>
 <li>For the red player use the W and S keys to control the racket</li>
 <li>For the blue player use the UP and DOWN arrows to control the racket</li>
 <li>Have a good game!</li>
 </ul>

## There will be updates?
Yes, currently I am studying Artificial Intelligences and Machine Learning, in the future when I have more mastery of the subject I will implement a machine learning algorithm to play against the user.
